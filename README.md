# Jikan

This is a thin Ruby wrapper for [jikan.me](http://jikan.me) inspired heavily by [JikanPy](https://github.com/AWConant/jikanpy). This is pretty much work in progress and by any means not to be used in production. Documentation will be updated as the work progresses.

## Installation

**NOTE: This does not work yet until the gem is uploaded.**

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jikan'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jikan

## Usage

Will be updated.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
