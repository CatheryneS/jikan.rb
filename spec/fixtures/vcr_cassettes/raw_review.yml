        One for all, hole in one!\u201d \u2014Nadeshiko Kagamihara\r\nYuru Camp is
        one of the gems from the season. Who could have guessed a camping series would
        be fun, refreshing, and very entertaining? Also, no matter how you are feeling,
        after each episode you will end with a big smile on your face. Yuru Camp isn\u2019t
        about cute girls doing cute things. It is about how to enjoy simpler situations
        and how to maintain the proper mood and be happy under any circumstance. More
        important, the series irradiates that sensation to all the spectators. These
        girls give us a funny and delightful gem and will stayin our memories for
        a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward and easy to follow, it
        is fun, fresh and entertaining to watch. It focuses on camping. Yes, I envision
        the same thing you\u2019re thinking: camping, are you kidding me? How can
        you have a plotline about camping? It must be a fiasco. However, Yuri Camp
        is not dull, from a common event like camping, the authors create an amusing
        narration where all the characters take pleasure in camping. Keep in mind
        that maybe you want to go camping with your friends after the series because
        the characters\u2019 commitment is plausible, delightful and absorbing. The
        message given to the audience through the story\u2019s simplicity is enjoying
        the moments of life.\\n\\n\r\nAs a starting point, the pacing is perfect,
        and the way how all the characters are involved is pretty clever. It is remarkable
        seeing the correlation and the chemistry between them, no matter if they appear
        in the scene for few seconds, their actions complement the setting, and you
        don\u2019t feel them wasted. Every character has a different personality that
        boosts the dynamic through the storyline and embodies the meaning of friendship.
        Another notable aspect, the trust. Would you camp with someone you do not
        trust? The series enrich the plot with those values and propels them in each
        episode. For example, Rin likes camping alone, but she starts enjoying her
        time with Nadeshiko and considers her as a friend. Since they are a group
        of \u201cbuddies,\u201d they share their tastes (food, hobbies, fun). Also,
        the story maintains the realism and gives tips about camping. This small world
        is full of comical events and funny jokes executed at the perfect moment ingeniously.
        Look Nadeshiko, she may seem to be childish, yet she is very energetic, and
        she uses that side of her personality to be humorous. Just with her behavior,
        the characters seem flashy and feel happy. All this is possible because the
        authors care about the pacing and the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand,
        some spectators believe the series doesn\u2019t have a plot, so they consider
        the show boring. The simplicity of the narrative can be measured in the course
        of action and the mood while camping. How many of us have at least camping
        once in our lives? If it was a gratifying experience then this show will bring
        memories and forgotten desires, perhaps you could end remembering some of
        your old friends. This series demonstrates that every action, no matter how
        insignificant is, it would make our existence happier and enjoyable. For me,
        seeing how these characters admire a landscape, it is very remarkable. Maybe
        it is a clich\u00e9, but that easiness is what we call having a good time.
        Lastly, I have not found any negative aspect of the show. Nothing is perfect,
        yet the anime covers some basic ideas such as friendship, trust, passion,
        joy, and boosts them in a very entertaining way. Yuri Camp\u2019s beauty lies
        in its simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWe have five characters in the story. The most
        noticeable Is Nadeshiko because she is the one that which gathers the rest
        of the cast together, and she is the central point for most of the jokes.
        Nadeshiko is very energetic and blissful. She loves eating, and we can consider
        her a thrilled girl. The other main character, Rin. In the beginning, she
        enjoys camping alone, but Nadeshiko\u2019s influence may change her. Rin has
        more camping experience than the others.\\n\r\nThe remaining characters add
        fluency to the story. Aoi and Chiaki, they are the members of the Outdoor
        Activities Club. Thanks to Nadeshiko the club continues with the activities
        and start to plan camping meetings. Lastly Ena, she always mocks Rin. Something
        I notice is the lack of a detailed background, but the plot works very well
        without it. You only need to know they like camping and the rest will come
        from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good. One exciting
        part is how they care about the landscapes. It is a plus because most of the
        scenes are outside. The camera angles and the camera movement focus on the
        main characters. Also, the color palette is very vivid and catch the attention
        of your eyes. However, the character\u2019s design is standard compared with
        other series; it goes well with the simplicity of the plot. Regarding the
        sound, the score fills the moments and the jokes. It isn\u2019t bad. Although,
        sometimes you don\u2019t notice it because it is standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP
        and ED are great. I love those two songs. The lyrics and the rhythm work very
        well and are very catchy. Honestly, I hummed the OP for a whole day. I am
        getting crazy. =( \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the combination between a simple and
        a fluid narrative, good characters, attractive art design, right sound, creates
        a delightful story called Yuru Camp. I like the show, I want a second season
        but maybe isn\u2019t going to happen, yet it was a hilarious ride. You must
        give this anime an opportunity.  \\n"},{"mal_id":274553,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274553","helpful_count":81,"date":"2018-03-22T09:09:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/TuyNOM","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4797625.jpg","username":"TuyNOM","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":8,"story":0,"animation":0,"sound":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0}},"content":"I
        think that sometimes, to relax, we need to explore other unusual places, almost
        exotic, to realize how the nature around us is so exceptional. That''s what
        Yuru Camp is trying to demonstrate. We don''t always need awesome things like
        explosions, magic powers to make an interesting show. \r\nStory: Yuru Camp
        focuses on a theme: camping. We follow the daily life of Shima Rin (nicknamed
        Shimarin) who goes camping regularly on her days off. She meets the happy
        Nadeshiko who knows nothing about camping. After a little conversation and
        a delicious dinner in front of the incredible Mount Fuji, Nadeshiko develops
        a taste for camping.\r\nThosetwo girls attend the same high school. Nadeshiko
        also meets Aoi and Chiaki, two girls who formed the camping club. The latter
        is not so successful and has little budget. As for Shimarin, she prefers to
        go camping alone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how the girls of the club will progressively
        be prepared for their adventure. Buy the equipment, the food necessary to
        spend a night in the mountains. Since we are in a cold period of the year,
        they also make sure they have the means to warm up. This is not always easy
        since the club doesn''t have a lot of budget and must be satisfied with their
        tent costing 980 yen.\\n\r\nIt''s fun to see what means they will use to do
        their first camping. The anime does a great job explaining in detail the different
        types of existing materials and the tasty dishes to cook when we go camping.
        it is really trying to convey to us the passion of its characters for camping.
        I honestly understand why Nadeshiko and her friends are so motivated.\\n\\n\r\nShimarin
        travels alone (over hundreds of kilometers) to discover the sublime landscapes
        and peaceful places in the prefecture. The girls will make a lot of use of
        the instant messaging system. Each of them will send a photo to show her the
        places she visited or banalities. This is how the relationship between characters
        will progress (especially between Shimarin and Nadeshiko) and finally allow
        them to go together all together, later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship
        is essentially based on the unsaid. We feel that Shimarin is someone who is
        used to being alone, whether in high school or camping. Her chance meeting
        with Nadeshiko will change things and allow her to share her passion with
        other friends of the same age.\\n\r\nSometimes she doesn''t seem disinterested
        enough (except when she sees dogs) but in her heart, she really wants to have
        a good time with her new friends. For example, when Aoi will propose to go
        camping together. She refuses at first even if we can perceive a touch of
        regret in her words. Shimarin is usually mature, calm and resourceful.\\n\r\nAt
        the exact opposite, Nadeshiko behaves like a child (although she uses some
        old expressions) but she is sociable and always ready to go on an adventure
        with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the landscapes are absolutely
        sublime, really. They would be ideal for wallpapers. These different places
        impressed me and I was fascinated by their realistic appearance. C-station
        studio isn''t known to me but I will remember that excellent work. We can
        notice the use of CGI when Shimarin drives his moped.\\n\r\nThe vocal performances
        perfectly transpose the personality of our characters. Nadeshiko has an often
        playful voice, while Shimarin has a duller voice. The opening theme \"Shiny
        Days\" is catchy and the ending matches the relaxed atmosphere of the series.\\n\r\nThe
        soundtrack is one of the highlights of the series. It is reminiscent of Celtic
        folk music. Tateyama Akiyuki has really captured this peaceful atmosphere
        with his OST. Honestly, it''s a delight, and I can''t wait to listen to them
        in a flac version. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the series has clearly exceeded my
        expectations. It is an excellent iyashikei with a relaxing autumn\/winter
        atmosphere in Yamanashi that will make you smile regularly. The friendship
        between our cute characters is touching. Laid-back Camp is a success."},{"mal_id":274562,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274562","helpful_count":62,"date":"2018-03-22T10:56:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/KeyboardKafe","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4402111.jpg","username":"KeyboardKafe","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":6,"story":6,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":5,"enjoyment":6}},"content":"Another
        edition to the endlessly growing roster of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d
        anime.  I definitely know a certain SOMEONE who would love this show. \r\nSo
        what is Yuru Camp\u25b3? (Yes, you have to have the little tent). In English,
        the title is \u201cLaid Back\u201d Camp, and that honestly couldn\u2019t be
        more appropriate. It\u2019s about a group of girls that form a camping club
        at their school, and spend their breaks doing just that; camping. There\u2019s
        relaxing atmosphere, friendly humor, and tranquility. \r\nSo, being that it\u2019s
        this kind of Slice of Life, the story certainly means to be casually presented.
        It\u2019s a ripe candidatefor those days where you do nothing but sit back,
        eat snacks, and refuse to care about anything else for at least 24 minutes
        of runtime (288 if you just watch the whole thing in one go, which is acceptable
        to me, being only a 12 episode show). \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the
        show is bad, I really don\u2019t think that\u2014but if you wanted something
        profound, look elsewhere. Yuru Camp\u25b3 is a show for the people who appreciate
        calm, happy presentations of friendship, hobby exploration, and overall contentment.
        There\u2019s nothing but smiles to be had, but it does it in a way that is
        neither over the top nor painful. We can find joy in how smoothly the anime
        incorporates naturalistic imagery alongside comfortable music and some pretty
        adorable characters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the characters in the show are
        completely defined by their love of camping and their girlish charm. Again,
        I just cannot stress enough that this story is not trying to be anything more.
        They don\u2019t need to be deeply complex for this type of thing; they serve
        the experience well enough with just having well-defined archetypes. Still,
        while I wouldn\u2019t call this a detractor, it\u2019s scoring no points\u2014it
        breaks even. The story has little going for it other than the demeanor with
        which it''s shown... they camp. That''s honestly, really all it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe
        animation is honestly wonderful, though. The colors are defined and the motion
        flows so much better than a lot of other shows that you\u2019d be entirely
        forgiven for coming to Yuru Camp\u25b3 for how it looks and the way it makes
        you feel. You definitely won''t find much else.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tConsistently
        relaxing atmosphere. \\n\r\n-\tCamping tips and knowledge are pretty prevalent
        throughout, to the point where I learned a few things I didn\u2019t know before,
        and was appreciative that they had been taught to me through a decently entertaining
        show. \\n\r\n-\tI can\u2019t honestly say it\u2019s really boring, parts of
        the show did make me chuckle at times and I appreciated the camaraderie amongst
        the characters.\\n\r\n-\tWOW that opening. And ending. The music in this show
        is phenomenal, as is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nMIXED: \\n\r\n-\tIt does nothing
        new, yet does nothing wrong. It loses no money, yet makes no money. In business
        we call this \u201cbreaking even.\u201d \\n\r\n-\tHardly more emotions to
        be found other than pure joy and quiet peace. Also, some silliness here and
        there.\\n\r\n-\tIt\u2019s pretty much unspoilable. You can take this in two
        ways \u2013 one, that the show has no story; or two, the show presents a \u201cunique\u201d
        type of story. Both are acceptable descriptors. \\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tThis
        is yet another one of those shows where cute girls do cute things, and it
        seems like they only exist for the explicit reason of camping every week.
        There\u2019s no depth to be seen, and while I didn''t hate them, being archetypes
        is nothing to celebrate. \\n\r\n-\tSometimes the series watches like an advertisement
        for various products and campsites around Japan, and honestly, I expect that
        this is exactly what it is. \\n\\n\r\nUpon writing this review, I discovered
        that this anime is based on a manga, and I couldn\u2019t be less surprised.
        According to my Japanese friends, who I\u2019ve spoken to about anime and
        manga quite extensively, manga is pretty damn popular in Japan, and there
        are manga for virtually everything and everyone. So it comes to me as no surprise
        that there\u2019s a manga exclusively about real camping locations, ways to
        camp there, and little else other than cute girls\u2014it would be something
        that a bunch of kids pick up at the market on the way to their OWN camping
        trip to read before they snooze off or right after dinner. Simple, inoffensive,
        and quite adorable at times. \\n\\n\r\nBut is it any more? \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t
        think so. \\n\\n"},{"mal_id":269697,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=269697","helpful_count":41,"date":"2018-01-26T05:51:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/ItzToxic","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/5306763.jpg","username":"ItzToxic","episodes_seen":4,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":8,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":10,"enjoyment":9}},"content":"Sit
        back, relax, and gaze upon the glory that is Yuru Camp.\r\nTbh I never expected
        to enjoy a series this much. With all the anime going on on a Thursday, this
        is definitely a great way to end it. The first episode already captivated
        me with its amazing soundtrack, character design, and background art.\r\nOur
        main character Rin, is someone who enjoys camping alone, we see that in episode
        1. She''s someone who would rather enjoy camping at her own leisure. However,
        because there are more amazing characters, she soon starts to meet them as
        well as open up to them more and becomes more social.I appreciate these character
        interactions because it''s so humanlike and it''s super sweet and all of them
        have chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it ain''t just the characters
        themselves, the background art and colours are super attractive and really
        compliments the anime very well. There''s also the fact that the background
        art and amazing colours are accompanied by the AMAZING OST. Each soundtrack
        piece really sets the vibe for each episode and each event that happens within
        Yuru Camp. Not to mention that GODLIKE OP. I''ve never heard such a catchier
        op than this one this season.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, apparently the campsites the
        girls'' go to camp at are actually based on actual locations. I saw a few
        pictures of it in its real life form and it really looks exactly as the anime
        shows. It''s amazing that these beautiful sites are real places to camp.\\n\\n\r\nSo
        in short:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8) - Very Simple, Rin who loves to camps meets a
        new girl who eventually befriends her and enjoys camping along with her in
        due time. Then more girls show up and then they''ll all camp together. A simple
        yet very well executed story that hits every note right.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)
        - Each character looks unique and the colours are well used.\\n\\n\r\nSound
        (10) - Easily one of the best OST''s I''ve heard and the appropriate timings
        used of these songs really makes the anime all the better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter
        (10) - Each girl carries a beautiful and amazing personality and shows as
        well as reminds us how cute the CGDCT genre can be. Each girl is lovable and
        will not disappoint in putting a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)
        - I''ve enjoyed each second that Yuru Camp has to offer. I''ve never got bored
        of this anime and it was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - If the goal of
        this anime was to give you a big smile and show you how girls can camp extremely
        well, then it does that very well. What can I say, it does everything right
        in terms of enjoyment, character, soundtracks, and beautiful art.\\n\\n\r\nYuru
        Camp will always be the anime to end my Thursdays. Now if you''ll excuse me,
        I need some Ramen.\\n"},{"mal_id":274544,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274544","helpful_count":37,"date":"2018-03-22T08:16:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Moelancholy","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/5539536.jpg","username":"Moelancholy","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":8,"story":0,"animation":8,"sound":7,"character":7,"enjoyment":8}},"content":"The
        sun is setting. The cold breezes that brushed through the yellow-green grass
        just a few minutes earlier have left the plains. In front of a small camping
        tent, Rin is comfortably seated in a folding chair, reading a book. A while
        has passed and she decides to put down her warm cup of cocoa, close her book
        and stretch; a puff of breath turns into a small cloud and slowly fades away.
        She looks at her surroundings: a huge, empty field of grass, a small forest
        and a clear view of a Mt. Fuji tinted in a friendly pink. Rin is on another
        ofher lonesome weekendly winter camping trips. During the coldest season,
        she fancies spending some time alone in the quiet areas of Japan\u2014on camping
        sites usually uncrowded during the winter. \\n\\n\r\nDuring her trips, she
        spends a lot of time exploring the camping grounds; in midst of beautifully
        drawn, colorful sceneries, she follows intricately painted pathways in search
        for the stunning sights of an everyday beauty of nature perfectly evoked by
        the show\u2019s wonderful visuals. Whether she ends up exploring the campsites,
        the colorful forests of early winter, taking pictures of funny-looking statues
        or just sitting in her chair relaxing, it doesn\u2019t really matter; she
        just wants to spend some time on her own enjoying nature. Apart from camping,
        she doesn\u2019t have any predominant interests or hobbies, and while she
        does truly love her friends and enjoys spending time with them, this pastime
        is something she truly needs: a breather, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nIt comes as
        no surprise when she turns down an invitation to join her school\u2019s camping
        club; it\u2019d go against the purpose of her camping trips. And really, that\u2019s
        completely okay. Her friends understand. While they may not truly grasp her
        feelings, they respect her desire to camp on her own without pressing further.
        This comes as kind of a surprise initially: in general, the members of the
        camping club are very energetic and gung-ho; seeing these characters which
        one might initially pass off as everyday anime idiots act like sensitive,
        genuine human beings and friends is truly, truly refreshing. Rin and them
        couldn\u2019t be more different: Chiaki and Aoi often indulge in weird jokes
        or pranks, and while their love for camping is definitely genuine, so is their
        aversion to spending even a single penny on actually acquiring necessary utensils.
        Nadeshiko on the other hand is very much a simpleton\u2014a hyperactive, hyperhappy
        and hyperhungry simpleton. It\u2019s not only the members of the camping club
        who differ from Rin (whose camping trips aren\u2019t as quiet and calming
        as Rin\u2019s); the three horse around and have fun. Instead of appreciating
        the quiet and nature, they just want to spend time and camp together as a
        group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the cast and the camping trips covering
        such a wide spectrum, the otherwise rather monotonous-sounding activity of
        winter camping can offer a variety of different, but always pleasant and comfy
        experiences. And while Rin and her friends may be apart when camping (well,
        most of the time), they are never out of touch: during their camping trips
        they regularly message or call each other and send the others photos of the
        camping sites they visit. They indulge in mindless but fun chats about food
        or the weather and it feels completely genuine. But not only do these small
        chats serve to make the character\u2019s relationships feel real, they also
        help the otherwise standalone camping trip segments connect to the rest of
        the show to form a cohesive whole; while the general moods of Rin\u2019s camping
        trips and the camping club horsing around are completely different, they still
        feel like parts of the same show, not fragments of a greater whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt
        isn\u2019t just these small conversations between the group and Rin that creates
        the feeling of unity between every single scene. Yuru Camp\u2019s soundtrack
        consists of very few songs which, while usually a negative, works well for
        what the show is trying to accomplish. The tracks are all very simple, but
        they sell their respective scenes perfectly through equally simple means:
        a short, repeated trill in the lead guitar is enough to sell the relaxing
        camping atmosphere; a change from a dominant guitar to flutes can be mystifying
        and create a sense of exploration; and a calm vocal song is enough to sell
        the most intimate of togetherness. It won\u2019t earn any medals or prizes,
        but the soundtrack does just what it\u2019s supposed to, and that\u2019s just
        what you want for an equally simple and relaxing show such as Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nBe
        it Rin\u2019s appreciation for the quiet and nature, the lively and fun friendship
        of the camping club or their genuine and heartwarming relationships\u2014there
        is much to love in this soothing show. Yuru Camp may seldom stray off the
        beaten path, but it doesn\u2019t need to, for it is a comfy and lighthearted
        experience through and through.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you decide to join in
        on the fun please keep in mind that while camping\u2026\\n\\n\r\n- Always
        mind the campsite and facility rules\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t forget to clean up
        fires and take your trash!\\n\r\n- It gets cold during the winter. Stay warm
        and be well-prepared!!\\n\r\n- Have fun :)\\n\\n\r\nScore: 75\\n"},{"mal_id":272448,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=272448","helpful_count":25,"date":"2018-02-25T10:17:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/MobFitzfire101","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/6312128.jpg","username":"MobFitzfire101","episodes_seen":4,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":3,"animation":6,"sound":5,"character":2,"enjoyment":3}},"content":"If
        the only purpose of Yuru Camp was to create a very cute, shallow, flavor of
        the week moe show, then they\u2019ve succeeded brilliantly. If it attempted
        to be something more than that, it failed brilliantly.\r\nStory(3): Like most
        cute girls doing cute things shows, this show has little to offer in the way
        of story. This is a character driven show about a group of girls making friends
        and messing around in their club. There\u2019s hardly any conflict at all,
        the girls simply go about their lives. \r\nArt(6): The character designs do
        a great job of selling of cutsey part of the show, and doa good job clueing
        us on their personalities, as one dimensional as they may be. The pink hair
        girl has to be one of the most satisfying cute girl character designs I\u2019ve
        seen in a while. I can\u2019t say I remember the backgrounds being particularly
        notable, though, even in the parts where they are attempting to show off Mount
        Fuji. The animation isn\u2019t anything special either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(2):
        A cute girls doing cute things show doesn\u2019t always need to have a plot.
        They survive and die on the strength of their characters personalities and
        their relationships with each other. This is where the show really falls short.
        Each character could easily be summed up in one sentence. When they are put
        into situations, they interact in the most clich\u00e9 and predictable ways
        possible. They\u2019re not just laid back, they\u2019re boring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(3):
        Because of the lack of thought or effort put into these characters, I found
        myself getting bored half way through the first episode. I pushed through
        a couple more because the MAL score here was so far, hoping it got better.
        It didn\u2019t, only adding more on dimensional characters that the show failed
        to make me care about.\\n"},{"mal_id":280860,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=280860","helpful_count":21,"date":"2018-05-18T10:54:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/nicky0_","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/5801770.jpg","username":"nicky0_","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":8,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":9,"enjoyment":8}},"content":"\u201cComfy\u201d
        seems to be the name of the game this season \u2013 we are awash in comfy,
        cozy slice-of-lifes and low-key character dramas, offering plenty of diverse
        warm antidotes to these cold winter months. But one show in particular is
        finding comfort in a place I never expected \u2013 the brisk, wide-open winter
        outdoors. So today we will explore Laid-Back, a work that finds coziness in
        the bustle and beauty of camping out.\r\nLaid-Back Camp has quietly become
        one of my favorite shows of the season. Though I\u2019d consider myself a
        slice of life fan, many of the genre\u2019s shows don\u2019t appeal to me
        \u2013 anatural result of slice of life actually being a mega-genre encompassing
        multiple genres; from sneaky comedies to the most tonal appeal of a work dedicated
        to iyashikei (works of simple and quiet content, where the focus is more on
        creating a strong sense of peaceful and disturbing atmosphere). I appreciate
        not only the iyashikei material of the character Rin, but also the way Yuru
        Camp treats this material.\\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate \u201cgoal\u201d of many
        slice of life shows is some character\u2019s full integration into a new social
        group. This \u201cgoal\u201d generally isn\u2019t framed as a difficult struggle
        they grapple with over the course of an entire season \u2013 normally it\u2019s
        just an early anxiety that fades when they find friends within a show\u2019s
        first twenty minutes. Slice of life shows of the more \u201ccute clubroom
        activities\u201d variety thus naturally valorize this idea that spending all
        your time with close friends is the most rewarding way to appreciate your
        youth, which makes sense \u2013 after all, that\u2019s the experience they\u2019re
        ultimately trying to depict and celebrate. But counterbalancing that genre-natural
        drive is Rin\u2019s equally genre-natural material, and I feel Laid Back Camp\u2019s
        respect for Rin\u2019s own feelings and desires is one of its finest qualities.
        \\n\\n\r\nInstead of being presented as a lonely girl who simply can\u2019t
        find close friends, Rin is a happy loner, a person who enjoys going on camping
        trips all by herself. That aspect of her character, her willingness to enjoy
        time by herself, is actually the quality which prompts her initial meeting
        with Nadeshiko in the first place, and which guides much of the show\u2019s
        drama even once the full cast is introduced. The validity of Rin\u2019s preference
        for solitude is thus clear from the start, and Laid Back Camp works hard to
        make the satisfying lived experience of Rin\u2019s journeys just as clear.Isolated
        characters in slice of life shows are often framed as temporarily impoverished
        extroverts \u2013 alone now, but desperate for companionship, and immediately
        evolving into social butterflies the moment their environment shifts. But
        Laid-Back Camp doesn\u2019t do that at all. Not only does finding new friends
        not do anything to change Rin\u2019s fundamental personality or desire for
        space, but its solo trips with Rin emphatically demonstrate the joy of spending
        time by yourself. The peace of solitude, the satisfaction of making decisions
        and solving problems through your own means, the small relationships you develop
        with objects in your environment, the running conversations you end up having
        with yourself\u2026 all of these tiny details bring the quiet joy of time
        alone vividly to life. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to clearly articulating the pleasures
        of time spent alone, Laid-Back Camp also takes care to never frame Rin\u2019s
        personality or feelings as something to be \u201cfixed,\u201d or a failing
        she should be actively guided away from. Rin\u2019s new friends want to spend
        time with her, but they respect her need for space as well. The course of
        Laid-Back Camp\u2019s narrative may seem circuitous, given Rin\u2019s rambling
        back-and-forth between solo and group trips, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s
        not a journey from \u201cI\u2019m camping alone\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ve found
        friends to camp with.\u201d Friends or not, Rin still plans on enjoying her
        solo trips, and her friends respect that desire. Sometimes she\u2019ll want
        to spend time with friends and sometimes she won\u2019t, and both of those
        feelings are perfectly okay.\\n\\n\r\nAs Laid-Back Camp begins, we''re treated
        to beautiful roadside backgrounds and a perky, whistle-infused soundtrack,
        courtesy of talented Kemono Friends composer Akiyuki Tateyama. His unique
        songs are perfectly suited to illustrating the peaceful atmosphere of Rin''s
        first trip, as we watch her putter across the countryside and arrive at a
        quiet lakeside campsite. Rin''s process of setting up camp is illustrated
        in full, careful animation detailing the physical mechanics of propping up
        a tent, searching for firewood, and settling in for the evening. Even if you''ve
        never been camping, Laid-Back Camp''s attention to detail and tonal holism
        in these early minutes brings Rin''s experience to life, relaying the unique
        appeal of camping all by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episode continues, Rin
        is introduced to Nadeshiko, whose goofy expressions, odd non-sequiturs, and
        general enthusiasm make for a dramatic contrast with Rin''s quiet solo material.
        This contrast is Laid-Back Camp''s secret weapon, underlining a balance that
        steers the show from first episode to last. Rin''s solo trips consistently
        offer a vividly realized iyashikei appeal, succeeding through their understated
        aesthetic strength and powerful atmosphere. Meanwhile, Nadeshiko spends Laid-Back
        Camp''s running time steadily recruiting more camping buddies, whose boisterous
        adventures consistently nail the appeal of traditional \u201cgirls in a clubroom\u201d
        slice of life. Laid-Back Camp thus represents two very different but equally
        appealing subgenres of slice of life through each of its leads, and balances
        the prominence of each throughout.\\n\\n\r\nAs that rapturous description
        of Laid-Back Camp''s early minutes might imply, I''m personally more fond
        of Laid-Back Camp''s iyashikei material, and appreciate the show''s dedication
        to honoring Rin''s desire for personal space. That said, the material focused
        on Nadeshiko and her friends is just as compelling in its own way, if a little
        more genre-standard. Nadeshiko''s personality falls somewhere between K-ON!''s
        Yui and Nintendo''s Kirby, and her enthusiasm is just as infectious as Yui''s.
        The show offers great expression work, a believable rapport between close
        friends, and plenty of standout gags, with even its style of comedy adjusting
        to suit the tonal needs of Rin and Nadeshiko''s very different stories.\\n\\n\r\nIn
        terms of visual execution, Laid-Back Camp is a solidly above par production.
        The show''s backgrounds are easily one of its standouts, and great care is
        taken to impress Rin''s various destinations with a sense of both beauty and
        realism. The campsites these girls visit feel lovely even in their mundanity,
        the careful detailing of camp benches and ill-kept roads feeling just as enchanting
        as the long shots of Fuji. The show''s animation is mostly just functional,
        but its expression work is excellent, and the aforementioned music is a consistent
        highlight. And that''s before mentioning the terrific opening song, which
        builds from the opening notes of I Want You Back to offer one of the most
        catchy anime songs of the year so far.\\n\\n\r\nI have nitpicks about Laid-Back
        Camp, but they''re minor issues that don''t really dampen the appeal of the
        whole. It''s clear enough that some of the show''s episodes were outsourced
        to studios that couldn''t manage Laid-Back Camp''s usual aesthetic standard,
        leading to some forced simplicity and episodes that lean on Nadeshiko''s comedy
        simply because they can''t manage Rin''s atmosphere. Not all the show''s gags
        are winners, and if you don''t have at least some fondness for both iyashikei
        and club comedy slice of life, you''ll likely end up with a pretty lopsided
        experience. All in all, the show possesses just a slight roughness around
        the edges that keeps it from the highest tier of slice of life, but none of
        that prevents it from being an extremely worthwhile show.\\n\\n\r\nLaid-Back
        Camp cuts out all of the inconveniences while carefully capturing the immediate
        experience of pitching a tent, foraging for firewood, settling into your seat,
        and simply appreciating the beauty around you. It\u2019s essentially like
        sitting inside, snugly bundled up, while watching a blizzard coat the world
        outside in deep white. All the allure of the wild from the comfort of home.\\n\\n\\n"},{"mal_id":274550,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274550","helpful_count":14,"date":"2018-03-22T08:38:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/AmishaelMA","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/6201866.jpg","username":"AmishaelMA","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":7,"story":6,"animation":10,"sound":9,"character":8,"enjoyment":7}},"content":"Camping

        (Further than the Universe) cute girls in the apocalypse (Girls\u2019 Last
        Tour), cute girls singing, dancing, and playing instruments (anime like K-On!,
        Love-Live! And Hibike! Euphonium), and just cute girls doing nothing whatsoever
        (Lucky star and Yuyushiki). Now we have cute girls going camping.\r\nIt literally
        does what it says on the packet. It\u2019s a very relaxed slice-of-life anime
        about camping, including all the aspects you would expect to see in a camping
        anime. It goes into great detail about the campsites they visit, the equipment
        they use (everything from how they buy it tohow they set it up), the food
        they make (which by the way, looks amazing and will make you hungry if you
        watch it before eating), and the way they bond through camping together. I
        learnt enough about camping from this one anime that, assuming I ever wanted
        to go, I would know exactly how to prepare and what to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s
        nice to watch. It\u2019s very slow paced, each episode generally consists
        of planning and executing a different camping trip. The art and animation
        are fantastic; the scenery in particular is drawn absolutely beautifully.
        All the right colours and tones are used to convey the autumn-like feeling
        perfectly. The sound also fits the mood of the anime to a T. \\n\\n\r\nThere
        are five main characters, although the story mainly focusses on two of them.
        Rin is the silent one who enjoys the peace and quiet of camping alone. She
        doesn\u2019t tend to socialise much, and this is what makes her friendship
        with the outgoing and talkative Nadeshiko endearing to watch. You get to know
        Rin through her actions \u2013 the way her face lights up when she sips a
        hot cocoa, the way she stares at a gorgeous view like she\u2019s trying to
        devour it, the way she cares about her friends despite sometimes acting like
        they\u2019re a nuisance to her. She\u2019s very relatable as a character,
        and that\u2019s part of why I liked the anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko,
        as mentioned before, is the talkative one. She\u2019s also the clumsy, energetic
        and downright adorable one. She\u2019s the type of girl who injects life into
        the anime, and helps speed up the pace when it becomes too snail-like. Her
        becoming friends with Rin is essentially the premise of the anime \u2013 they
        meet by chance on a camping site, and, in the way of anime, find out they
        go to the same school together. She and Rin are a lot like chalk and cheese;
        apart from their love of camping they couldn\u2019t be more different. However
        their friendship blossoms nonetheless, and by the end of the anime they\u2019ve
        formed a solid relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are relatively
        enjoyable to watch, although they aren\u2019t as developed as Rin and Nadeshiko.
        Aki and Aoi are girls in the same camping club as Nadeshiko, and Ena is a
        friend of Rin\u2019s who\u2019s persuaded to come along for the ride. Apart
        from camping, the anime mainly shows them in school, going shopping, working
        and just hanging out together. Nothing exciting or even particularly interesting,
        but their interactions are mildly humorous, very light-hearted, and always
        cute. The series shows how they each react to the camping aspect, and what
        each of them actually enjoys about camping. For some it\u2019s the peace,
        for some it\u2019s the food, and for some it\u2019s the companionship. Regardless,
        after watching this I felt I would probably enjoy camping too for one reason
        or the other. \\n\\n\r\nNow, although I said this anime was nice to watch,
        I wouldn\u2019t call it entertaining. It\u2019s more like you feel contented
        with the world after watching it. I had to be in a certain frame of mind to
        see it \u2013 when I was in the mood for something fast-paced and thrilling,
        I watched another anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for something
        tranquil, something cute and relaxing, this is a good choice. If you\u2019re
        not, then I\u2019d give this one a miss until you are.

        Camp can easily be described as the break out hit of the season, I highly
        doubt anyone could have predicted that Yuru Camp would have gotten as popular
        and highly regarded as it is. Yuru Camp does a lot right, but, I have a myriad
        of problems with the show; iyashikei is not a slice of life sub-genre and
        shouldn''t be considered as such. Like the Thriller genre and the Mystery
        genre, it''s easy to point out the similarities between both genres; but,
        what separates iyashikei and the slice of life genre is how they go about
        character development and narrative. Slice of lifeshows, like K-On, Gochiusa,
        and Nichijou, either are all sitcom-likes or they have a character driven
        story, Iyashikei shows on the other hand is setting oriented. Usually the
        settings of Iyashikei shows carry the story, the settings are often personified
        and have heavy symbolic significance within the narrative, the story and the
        appeal of Aria is largely based upon the interactions between the characters
        and the world of Aqua. Hidamari Sketch is a good example of a genre blend,
        the Hidamari apartments do hold significant value to the characters and does
        have symbolic value throughout the series, but on a moment to moment basis
        the appeal of the show is the interaction between characters. The same is
        true of Non Non Biyori. The slice of life genre and the iyashikei genre both
        attempt to capture the realities of life, but structure and the appeal of
        an iyashikei show is fundamentally different from that of a slice of life
        show. The appeal and structures of shows like Yokohama, Mushishi, Sketchbook,
        and Aria is completely different from the appeal of shows like Gochiusa, K-On,
        Demi-Chan, Yuru Yuri, and Kiniro Mosaic. It''s easy to see why Iyashikei is
        considered a sub-genre, there are countless genre blends; but the iyashikei
        genre has grown so large and utilizes such different modes of character development
        and story telling, that one would be hard pressed to say that they are within
        the same genre when the shows on an individual level is examined.\\n\\n\r\nThe
        appeal of Yuru Camp is similar to Iyashikei shows, but the actual characters
        are written as if they are slice of life characters; every character except
        for Shima Rin is one dimensional, they are written around one character trait
        and most of the gags of the show revolves around seeing these character archetypes
        interact. Nadeshiko is the simple glutton archetype, Inuyama is the mother
        archetype, and Oogaki is the prankster archetype. Admittedly, most of the
        comedy in the show hits me, I laugh almost every episode; but had the show
        revolved around those three, I would have dropped the show by this point.
        Shima Rin is probably the most interesting character in the series, her introverted
        nature and passion for camping makes for an interesting juxtaposition to the
        members of the outdoors club. Most episodes can be divided into two parts,
        seeing the outdoor club going camping, and seeing Shima Rin go camping. The
        moments when the outdoor club goes camping is a great example of the typical
        slice of life show, the moments when Shima Rin goes camping is the closest
        the show come to being a proper iyashikaei show. Shima Rin gives the show
        a contemplative edge that is much needed. She is the tone setter of the show,
        she is what makes the show comfortable. Her interactions with nature isn''t
        only fascinating but compelling. \\n\\n\r\nWhen discussing Yuru Camp with
        my friends, they often bring up how ''atmospheric'' the show is, they often
        note the sound design and the beauty of the setting as whats appealing about
        the show; I disagree with the notion that Yuru Camp is atmospheric, if anything,
        it is universally accessible. The background art is based on real japanese
        campsites, it captures the feeling of camping very well, but the cartoonish
        designs of the Yuru Camp characters clashes poorly with the realistic background
        art. The character designs are cute, but they diminish the effect of the background
        art. The sound design of Yuru Camp is mediocre at best, the camp grounds don''t
        actually feel that realistic, at least in comparison to other series. Yuru
        Camp is no Yokohama, or even Non Non Biyori in this regard. The most impressive
        use of sound was in Episode 7, when Nadeshiko and Shimarin are talking and
        the sounds of the camp fire is played over the subsequent flashbacks. The
        openings and the ending both sound pretty generic, but they fit the series
        well. The sound track of Yuru Camp is what first comes to mind when anyone
        says ''camping music.'' The actual soundtrack of Yuru Camp is as generic as
        it gets. All of these factors coalesce into making the most accessible slice
        of life show i''ve ever seen, it avoids emotions other than happiness, and
        at times this becomes very grating because the show doesn''t evolve in any
        way as time goes on. It makes Yuru Camp a very easy anime to recommend, it
        is perhaps the most relaxing shows i''ve ever seen; but the lack of character
        development and the mediocre art direction is a huge obstacle to me giving
        the show a higher score."},{"mal_id":275068,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=275068","helpful_count":9,"date":"2018-03-25T17:06:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Artrill","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/5554102.jpg","username":"Artrill","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":6,"story":5,"animation":7,"sound":7,"character":5,"enjoyment":6}},"content":"[6.0\/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nEver
        spend the afternoon listening to those lo-fi hip-hop playlists on Youtube?
        The ones that play a long playlist of relaxing instrumentals over gifs of
        animated characters either studying, reading, or floating in outer space?
        If so, then you have probably experienced, through audio, the kind of feeling
        that Yuru Camp embodies and presents to you. The chirping birds and licking
        of river water as it wraps around the rocky shoreline. A group of students
        out at campsites, under no threat, in no danger, with no drama, cooking food
        for one another and conversing about what they value. The term here is \u201claid-back\u201d,
        and theshow translates that for its title. \\n\\n\r\nThe series here follows
        Shima Rin as she camps out in various locations around Mount Fuji, from lakes
        to open fields. Along the way, she meets Nadeshiko, a spunky, goofy pink-haired
        girl that has a similar, yet louder passion for camping. Later, we realize
        they go to the same school and lo-and-behold there is even a camping club,
        because of course there is, with a few other equally cute girls with a seemingly
        diehard passion for sleeping in linen huts outside. That\u2019s our story.
        No less and no more. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here we venture into their day-to-day
        lives. Without the burden of classes, social interaction, or growth for anyone
        but maybe Rin towards the end of the series. It really feels like a flatline
        in the best possible way, I suppose. As in, the line here is \u201ccomfort\u201d
        and the series encapsulates that comfort as well as it can within the parameters
        it draws. These parameters being the set locations during the winter in the
        small vicinity around where these characters live in Japan. It isn\u2019t
        for everyone but fortunately, it offers a lot to the crowd that really seems
        attached to the iyashikei presentation with a healthy dollop of feel-good
        humor. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Camping
        Under the Stars and Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nFunny faces, chibi inspired designs,
        and crackling campfires, Yuru Camp isn\u2019t going to blow you away visually.
        Much like the rest of the series, it often has an air of decentness that you
        can\u2019t help but acquiesce to after a few episodes roll by without your
        notice. That\u2019s kind of the charm of it. The character design is serviceable,
        without many standouts. Each girl has the expected wide pallet of hair-color
        and generally looks alright. Where the series, and the people making it, clearly
        put the most thought into was the honestly great variety of outfits worn.
        Now each one is a variation of winter-clothing, but they were never ridiculous
        or unbelievable and, throughout the runtime, each episode seemingly had a
        unique selection of designs to attach to these characters. Good stuff all
        around, here. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also not anemic, thankfully. The opening
        is catchy, the closer is quite frankly the best track in the series, and there
        enough background tunes to keep you engaged and on occasion bob your head
        to. Similar to those lo-fi hip-hop beats, that kind of melodic, unobtrusive,
        and relaxing feeling is injected into the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also
        nothing licentious here. Everything doesn\u2019t feel like it is there to
        sell sex. While this is something I hate to bring up in every anime I seem
        to review, it is a problem that just plagues this medium. While this series
        is easily pandering to a certain crowd, it\u2019s not doing so through sexual
        means and is never obnoxious about it and I will gladly take a series that
        doesn\u2019t drill sexual fanservice into your eyes every chance it gets.
        The entire thing feels wholesome, and a focus on sexualization would undermine
        that. The creatives seem to understand this and avoid it. Even the scenes
        in the hot springs are very neutral and don\u2019t have anything sleazy under
        the hood. Thumbs up for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the presentation is solid.
        I might even call it above average. It is where I expect a show like this
        to be. The directing is generally unremarkable, but the music and the decent
        production more than make up for that. The voice acting didn\u2019t blow my
        socks off but thankfully it avoids being shrill and loud. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Narrative,
        Characters, or Lack Thereof] \\n\\n\r\nDeadpan high schoolers, eccentric glasses,
        and alcoholic teachers with seemingly no care for students, there really isn\u2019t
        much to latch onto in this show. Of course, that\u2019s my opinion and I\u2019m
        sure for some just the serene experience of the whole thing can be enough.
        The atmosphere here is exceptional, but the characters that inhabit the atmosphere
        are about as normal as they come. Each one possesses a very minuscule amount
        of quirks or habits that didn\u2019t do much to intrigue me. While you could
        argue that\u2019s the point and the series wasn\u2019t trying to intrigue
        me, I can\u2019t help but feel like they could\u2019ve done more with these
        characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a show without a shred of conflict is just
        that, though, a show without a shred of conflict. Conflict grows characters
        and the deepest conflict here is often running out of food to eat. Again,
        that\u2019s the point, but there really should\u2019ve been more to the characters
        that we got to learn about as they bonded together. These girls, the four
        specific ones that took up most of the show, don\u2019t change or give us,
        the viewer, anything to chew on other than pretty scenery and delicious looking
        food. Which is a plus, the food looks great and watching cute girls eat food
        is something I will unabashedly indulge in (especially when it isn\u2019t
        obnoxiously over the top). Even Rin, our protagonist, who goes through the
        biggest \u201carc\u201d of the series doesn\u2019t get much to think about
        or ponder. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of conflict is a flaw in entertainment value,
        but a flaw that I think will easily be looked past by the people specifically
        looking for a series that doesn\u2019t have conflict and is an iyashekei.
        That\u2019s kind of the sharp-end of criticism, though, the flaws I see are
        often not what someone else sees. The nonchalant atmosphere is nice to sit
        back and enjoy, however, I doubt I\u2019ll be thinking back to this series
        as something memorable or worth revisiting. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nDo
        you want an overtly wholesome parade of cute anime girls camping? The comedy
        here isn\u2019t in abundance, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s okay for anime
        comedy, too, occasionally making me breath air out of my nose. Yuru Camp relies
        on expectations more than anything. What do you want and ultimately, what
        engages you as a viewer? A lot of the flaws here, beyond some of the awkward
        CG vehicles and weaker animated segments are exceedingly subjective. It\u2019s
        hard to argue that this series isn\u2019t feel-good and it\u2019s almost impossible
        for me to say I didn\u2019t like a good portion of it. Even the slower moments
        were relaxing as all hell, and while the ideas presented here may feel myopic
        to some viewers, none of it felt tepid. Even the truly \u201claid-back\u201d
        moments, which manifested in five-minute segments of almost no dialogue, relaxing
        music, and maybe some monologuing, are relatively easy on the eyes and will,
        on more than one occasion, make you feel what this show is trying to make
        you feel. Comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and camping. This series makes you camp.
        Regardless of interesting characterization, what Yuru Camp does most well
        at is the meticulous creation of the scenarios at hand, here. A lot of the
        series is based on easy-reveals and drama-less conflict-resolution that feels
        good. For example, your hands are cold because it is cold out. You take your
        hand warmers and place them in your hands and exhale happily. That is a drama-less
        resolution, especially when one of your good friends walks up behind you and
        passes the hand-warmers to you and you smile and greet them. \\n\\n\r\nThis
        continues simply with the fact that the original creators of the manga this
        series is based on smartly made it set during the winter. A cold time that
        can often feel lonely alone. So of course, Rin, our lone-warrior of cute camping
        girls, ends up coming around and finding friends to camp with. Of course,
        there will be multiple scenes of snuggling up with yourself in a sleeping
        bag and cosplaying caterpillars. Because that\u2019s cute, and you can probably
        imagine just how warm that feeling is and in turn you are suddenly in a place
        of comfort and relaxation.  I commend the series for these smart creative
        choices that made for a better watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s the minuscule
        details to continue this streak of excessively unrealistic but ultimately
        satisfying interactions. Such as texting your friend at night and getting
        a response immediately. It almost never happens in the real world but damn
        it if it doesn\u2019t feel good when it does happen. Sharing a vista with
        a close one. Cooking food for someone and ultimately getting that favor returned
        by them later. Sharing a laugh. Admiring a sunset. Looking over the lake and
        not caring about tomorrow because hopefully today will last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThese
        are all great qualities and don\u2019t let my above-average score fool you.
        If you are seeking something like this, this may be the best show of the season
        for you. It is very time-oriented. If I was going through an excessively difficult
        time in real life and I threw this show on, at night, by myself, I would have
        most likely enjoyed it even more. Note that. Value what you value and don\u2019t
        let this wholesome series slip by you. \\n"},{"mal_id":274560,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274560","helpful_count":9,"date":"2018-03-22T10:08:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Mezo-RPWPA","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4063361.jpg","username":"Mezo-RPWPA","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10}},"content":"We
        all search for a place to escape the difficult parts in life, whether it be
        movies, games or anime, we all seek something that makes us relax and enjoy
        living rather than stress about how difficult life is, Yuru Camp I think is
        the best when it comes to avoiding all that stress. \r\nYuru Camp is the most
        relaxing experience you might ever have in your life, the anime is great and
        you notice that from how happy you feel watching the episodes, each episode
        is like a new adventure with all characters being so loveable and cute it
        makes it an even moreamazing experience, you get to see how great camping
        is, why people love doing it and the amazing scenery that makes you want to
        get up and travel there just to see how wonderful it looks and that pretty
        much explains a lot of the charm in Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn''t much
        in the story other than the girls camping but you still enjoy it a lot watching
        how each character interacts with the others and how they move on and become
        better friends and their relationships get stronger which is very satisfying
        to see. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I loved the Kino No Tabi reference at the end :D Both
        this and Kino are in my favorite anime list. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Yuru
        Camp are great from the 5 MCs to the side characters, they are all very cute
        and loveable with each of them having her own characteristics that makes her
        unique and different from the rest, My personal favorite is probably Inuyama
        or Nadeshiko, Inuyama is only above the others because of how good her character
        design is (even though the rest of the designs, hers is just my favorite)
        while Nadeshiko is also better than the rest because of how cute her character
        is but in terms of overall characteristics then all of them are pretty much
        on the same level which shows how much attention was put into the characters.
        \\n\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal, The designs are great and the scenery and
        background is outstanding, if you somehow hate the characters you could just
        turn off the sound and subtitles and just enjoy how stunning it looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe
        OSTs are great, the Opening and Ending are amazing specially the ending since
        it really fits the atmosphere and all of that shows how great the sound directing
        is, well to be honest the directing of the whole anime was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall
        I would give it a 10\/10 and I''m extremely sad watching one of the very few
        things that made me completely relaxed in my life end and I''m really going
        to miss it :''(  \\n\\n\r\nI can''t believe I almost didn''t watch it at the
        start of the season.\\n\r\nI can only hope for a 2nd season. \\n\\n\r\nI would

        a part of the medium of anime where school settings are common, Yuru Camp
        decides to take us to the outdoors, and provides us with a fresh, more rare
        setting to indulge ourselves in.\r\nA large part of the appeal of Yuru Camp
        to me and many others is how the activities being shown can all be attempted
        in real life. This not only leads more people to try outdoor activities, but
        it allows people like me to relate to the time we spend outdoors. In my case,
        after many years of camping, hiking, backpacking, and hunting in Oregon, this
        show brings back memories ofmy childhood spent outdoors and the joys of friendship.
        With a setting in a show that connects you to an enjoyable part of real life,
        a whole new level of enjoyment is reached.\\n\\n\r\nAccomponing the story
        of this show is a comfortable blend of incredible landscape scenes, music,
        and tremendously cute characters. Many of the landscapes present in Yuru Camp
        are based upon real life locations in Japan, even the art of this show can
        bring you to connect with real places! With the art comes the music, which
        is composed of a relaxing collection of guitars, flutes, and other noises
        that compliment the story and art perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters,
        which make or break cute shows like this. There are 2 characters in which
        the most time is spent on, Rin and Nadeshiko, they are pretty much polar opposites.
        Rin is calm, independent, and loves to spend time alone, while Nadeshiko is
        full of energy and finds excitement from everything. When the two spend time
        together or communicate over texting, you can often see their personalities
        clash and cause moments that make you smile. The rest of the cast does not
        see too much time until later on, but still has their fair share of enjoyable
        moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 more minor parts of Yuru Camp that really stood
        out to me, this would be the traveling, and the food. The traveling by Rin
        on her moped shows just how independent she is, Rin is able to show us a variety
        of different dogs and different locations. Additionally, she often communicates
        with Nadeshiko and other friends by means of texting, these texts are often
        some of the most hilarious and enjoyable parts, every text is voiced and animated
        on the entire screen. This approach was unique and adds much enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly,
        there is the food. The food in Yuru Camp is yet another part that can be attempted
        in real life. Food is a major component of camping and Yuru Camp does not
        shy away from showing that. The entire process of cooking is usually displayed,
        from the preparation of ingredients all the way to the cute blobs of moe consuming
        these glorious, steaming Nippon delicacies. The cuteness of the food being
        eaten is absolutely outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nWith Yuru Camp, you can wash away
        the stresses of your life and dive into a world of comfort that is never eroded,
        and once the episodes are over, you can bring the activities to the real world,
        and you can see that sometimes outside isn\u2019t too bad. If you need some
        happiness and comfort in your life, Yuru Camp will deliver that, 10 times
        over.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\/10\\n\r\nArt: 9\/10\\n\r\nSound: 9\/10\\n\r\nCharacter:

        cone said \"Konnichiwa!\". Welcome to Yuru Camp\u25b3, a cutesy take on the
        slice of life aspect of camping, following a group of adventurous girls who
        love the outdoors as much as each other!\r\nWhat sucked me in to this story
        of camping was that the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. Leaving out
        the frantic setting in other anime, it let blissfulness shine through in an
        adorably positive manner. As someone who only knows about camping very straightforwardly,
        the simple presentation on the tips and techniques were given in an understandable
        format, andI definitely didn''t mind learning about them! All the girls contained
        their own likable personalities, an entertaining factor on its own. Collectively,
        they were funny, happy, and all in all full of positivity. This was a simple
        yet great recipe to create a comfortable feeling of comfiness that warms you
        up. Their interactions with each other were pure. While they were close at
        heart upon meeting for the first time, the bonds became stronger every passing
        day in their camp life. It was an honest friendship that was enjoyable to
        watch while they set up their tents, cook their foods, or view the scenery
        as day turned into night. And I give my appreciation to the setting based
        on real sites such as Mount Fuji. These cozy areas seemed like they were great
        places to fully relax with nature.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I talk about setting, the
        outdoor landscapes were beautiful to look at. The attention to detail with
        the grass blowing or the reflections in the lake all added up into one simple
        but great visual. For the animation, it was essentially laid-back but it was
        a perfect complement for the peaceful atmosphere. Each girls possessed their
        own cute expressions when they were having a good time and I also loved their
        character designs. Their winter get-up was adorable, looking like a bundle
        of fluffiness. This presence of the girls enjoying the outdoor life together
        just makes the air around them so clean and refreshing. Ambience of natural
        sounds unwinded the body, preparing to absorb and connect to what nature can
        offer to us with its own environmental audio. Each scenes that were blown
        over by the soft soundtracks had a gentle and mellow vibe, enriching the quiet
        world of the lands away from the bustling cities. Whereas for the opening
        song, the upbeat tone matched the girls'' lively personalities, and the soothing
        ending song concluded their enjoyable day on a tranquil note.\\n\\n\r\nFeel
        free from the rush of everyday life and go breathe in the fresh air of nature
        around us. Yuru Camp\u25b3 takes out all the current hassle and stress out
        of you, leaving you with feelings of content and a pleasant smile at every
        episode. So what''s there more to wait? Bring in the marshmallows with you,

        the value of having people around and do camping together. \r\nMy favorite

        you ever wanted to go camping but without the camping? Yuru camp was made
        for you then. This is probably the most lighthearted show Ive ever seen. Enough
        backstory lets get to the review. \r\nStory is a 7\/10. Its not the most amazing
        story, its camping. Bland on paper but animated its quite the trip. Again
        its not a crazy wild story but its a damn good enough one to make a show out
        of. \r\nArt is a 9\/10. The art in this show is godly. Mt Fuji looks great,
        the characters are adorable, the food doesnt look like a sopping wet urinal
        cake.Its fantastic. I hope a season 2 of this show drops soon because id love
        to watch more. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is an 8\/10 mostly because the OP sounds
        like something from an 80''s sitcom. The voice actresses and actors perfectly
        fit the roll of the character they''ve been chosen to voice. \\n\\n\r\nWhich
        moves me on to the characters\\n\\n\r\n10\/10. Now they arent just 10\/10
        because muh waifu (which some of them are but shhh) its a 10 because the characters
        are fun to watch. Nadeshiko is an adorable pink haired girl with so little
        brain cells you get dumber just watching her but WHO CAAAAAAAARES shes cute
        (also once you hear her say rin chan its burned into your hearing). Rin is
        a girl who doesnt give a flying fuck-knuckle about nadeshiko but she puts
        up with her because camping alone isnt thaaaat much fun. Everyone else is
        stupid(except Aoi) because their role in the show isnt needed. \\n\\n\r\n9\/10
        for enjoyment. What can i say im a simple man. I see cute pink retard I click
        on cute pink retard. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL this show is probably an 8\/10. I wish

        of my favorite genres in anime is slice of life, I just really love how it
        makes me feel. Now there are different varieties of slice of life anime out
        there. There''s romance, drama, school setting, and just in general every
        day life.\r\nYuru Camp is a typical every day life type of anime. What is
        it about? It''s about a group of girls that go camping, and sometimes some
        of them go solo camping. And that''s pretty much it.\r\nAdmittedly it doesn''t
        have the most interesting of ideas, but it somehow makes it work. I fell in
        love with Rin and the rest of thegirls, seeing them interact and their friendship
        become stronger was just really rewarding to see.\\n\\n\r\nI''m an introvert
        in real life, so I''m always worried how anime will protray introverted characters,
        but in my opinion at least Rin is one of my favorite introverted characters
        out there. She wasn''t made fun of, she wasn''t hated on, no one thought she
        was strange for wanting time alone. \\n\\n\r\nShe''s not socially awkward,
        she''s not painfully shy. She''s just more quiet than most, and that is how
        I personally am in real life.\\n\\n\r\nSo of course I was drawn to Rin immediately.
        Rin is the main character. As I said before she''s a introvert, someone that
        likes being alone, but who doesn''t mind the company occasionally, and I like
        that.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko is a hyper active girl that loves to eat. Normally
        hyperactive characters can be hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed Nadeshiko''s
        character a lot. She actually reminded me of a friend I had in high school,
        who like Nadeshiko was just very happy go lucky\/hyperactive. Which was nice
        to see.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed how Rin and Nadeshiko''s interactions
        became more valuable as the series continued. While Rin was okay with Nadeshiko
        camping with her, it was almost as though she wasn''t quite sure how to act
        around her, in the sense that she looked at Nadeshiko oddly.\\n\\n\r\nBut
        as the series continued you could tell that they were becoming close friends.
        For instance Rin smiling whenever Nadeshiko did something, or Nadeshiko being
        so happy to see Rin.  \\n\\n\r\nNext is Aoi, a quiet, soft spoken girl who
        likes to joke around occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Chiaki: A very loud
        and out going girl who isn''t afraid to go after things that she wants.\\n\\n\r\nThere
        are other characters of course, but those are the main four characters. I
        really wish that Aoi and Chiaki had gotten more screen time, especially involving
        Rin, but their interactions were a lot of fun as well.\\n\\n\r\nI''m not an
        outdoor person, I personally hate the cold, but this series actually made
        me want to go camping. \\n\\n\r\nI adored the characters, the characters interactions
        were a lot of fun to watch. I felt so comfy and had a big smile the majority
        of the time I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had a normal length time in
        episodes, but it felt like just 5-10 minutes had passed instead of the 22+
        minutes. Not saying that''s how you''ll feel of course , that''s just how
        I personally felt with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a slice of life fan,
        than you will likely enjoy this series, if you aren''t a slice of life fan
        and are wanting to try slice of life series, maybe try something else first?
        And then work your way here? If you''re just starting out in the slice of
        life genre this might be too slice of life for you, but maybe not, the only
        one who will really know is you.\\n"},{"mal_id":274579,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=274579","helpful_count":7,"date":"2018-03-22T13:33:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/VISH_SRT","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/5622943.jpg","username":"VISH_SRT","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":8,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":10,"enjoyment":10}},"content":"Cute

        it\u2019s nice to relax. Maybe you\u2019ve been burned out on intense, energetic
        shows and need a change of pace. Maybe you\u2019ve come from a long day of
        work and need something to relieve the stress. Whatever the reason, you\u2019re
        looking for something a bit more laid-back that you can take in without having
        to pay too much attention to convoluted plots or segments with extended dialogue.
        This is the Iyashikei genre in a nutshell, often characterised by works like
        Mushishi and Flying Witch, shows in which comparatively little actually happen
        but which managed to be soothing through the beautiful ambience of their setting
        orthrough the joy of experiencing the simpler pleasures in life. In this regard,
        Yuru Camp is an Iyashikei through-and-through. \\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re treated
        to a series of gorgeous establishing shots of the scenery from the very beginning.
        While these shots aren\u2019t as detailed or vivid as you might get from a
        Shinkai film or a KyoAni series, they\u2019re still very impressive and immersed
        me in the series almost immediately. The environment is coloured with soft
        tones that blend with each other almost seamlessly. This contrasts with the
        designs for the characters themselves, which are much more vibrant in a way
        that perhaps reflects their lively nature, particularly for the bundle of
        joy that is Nadeshiko with her bright, pink hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack
        to this anime is stellar, with many of the tracks having a style that I can
        only describe as being a cross between celtic and traditional japanese folk.
        It''s a distinct sound that you''d recognise immediately upon hearing, but
        also low-key and pleasant to listen to. Other sound effects, such as the the
        breaking of sticks, fire, and even slapstick moments like Nadeshiko''s face
        sliding down a window all sound completely authentic and help pull you into
        the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, you have the stoic, reserved Rin
        who\u2019s most comfortable by herself, contrasting with the hyperactive bundle
        of energy that is Nadeshiko. It\u2019s one of my favourite character dynamics
        to witness in anime and it\u2019s almost always entertaining and incredibly
        cute to watch. There''s a number of side characters as well, all with personalities
        that make them a joy to watch even if they don''t get nearly as much development
        as the main pair. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface there\u2019s not really much of
        a story here, being a show about girls going camping and doing camping things.
        I would say that the core of the story is in how each girl develops as a person;
        how Nadeshiko discovers a new hobby through a chance encounter with Rin, and
        how Rin\u2019s interactions with different kinds of people changes her perspective
        on friendship and brings her out of her cold, seemingly impenetrable shell.
        \\n\\n\r\nThis show is an absolute pleasure to watch and very quickly became
        the highlight of my week. Whether you\u2019re watching this just after coming
        home from a long day at work or late at night before going to sleep, I think
        you\u2019ll really love this. It''s by far the comfiest show of the Winter
        2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nI can definitely see Yuru Camp becoming a new benchmark
        in the Iyashikei genre, much in the way Flying Witch and Aria were. Here''s
        hoping for a second season!"},{"mal_id":278268,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=278268","helpful_count":6,"date":"2018-04-16T17:02:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/jal90","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/402245.jpg","username":"jal90","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10}},"content":"Yuru
        Camp was a strange phenomenon to witness. An anime produced by a newish studio
        and an inexperienced staff, with a premise that looked about as basic and
        niche as it could, adapting a fairly unknown manga. Very few people looked
        forward to this show, and I was certainly not one of them as it didn''t look
        particularly appealing at first.\r\nAnd yet, it remains as the third highest-rated
        non-sequel show of its season, only behind two series that rely on more visceral
        and spectacular storytelling (Sora yori mo tooi basho and Violet Evergarden),
        with heavier themes and mood shifts. It is one of the best-sellingshows of
        the season as well, increasing manga sales, selling a lot of merchandise and,
        as of today, tripling the amount of visitors to the campsites located at the
        Yamanashi Prefecture the series focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, Yuru Camp
        is a show about camping. And not even about camping as a side element or room
        for more potentially exciting character quirks. About camping in itself as
        an experience, with a cast of characters that develop an interest and are
        always looking forward to, and grow, and set their focus on the activity.
        For twelve episodes. With no tension, no character drama, no external elements
        getting in the way and certainly not a sense of danger or heavy uncertainty.
        It is strict in what it covers and straightforward in what it wants to evoke.\\n\\n\r\nIn
        a way, that was an advantage to the show. Week after week, this was a safe
        choice with a clear attached mood that people could get into knowing what
        they''d expect and the exact kind of reaction they''d get from it. Some people
        probably didn''t like it, but they weren''t vocal: it''s not the kind of show
        that can lead to visceral hate. Not having any element that could generate
        controversy, it was only natural that the series grew through the season with
        very little negativity around it. The scenario for this backfiring was also
        clear: after all, what kind of appeal does this harmless fun provide compared
        with the more spectacular and memorable narratives of emotional struggle in
        its season?\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to answer, and yet, it becomes so clear when
        you are watching it. Selling Yuru Camp is difficult, as one would need to
        rely on vague statements about its mood. It''s quiet, it''s soothing, watch
        it whenever you need to chill. That''s it. I could end my review here and
        it would be the most straightforward recommendation because that is what this
        show is about: pure and unadulterated calmness and peace of mind. No more
        no less.\\n\\n\r\nBut that would be too easy and misleading. Because it''s
        not the simplicity and straightforwardness what makes this series work, but
        an execution that depends on a careful combination of directorial, cast, music
        and writing choices that shouldn''t be dismissed just because the aim of the
        show is humble and simplistic. It is masterfully crafted in each of these
        elements and almost nothing in it feels random or inappropriate for the overall
        mood.\\n\\n\r\nLet''s talk first about the visual aspects of the show. A lot
        of things have been said about the sheer beauty and detail of the backgrounds,
        the use of a subdued color palette that makes everything look more relaxed
        and soothing, the clever use of lighting and so on. Each episode provides
        a good amount of wallpaper material and they do a great work at enhancing
        the beauty of the landscapes. But I would like to focus on something this
        series really excels at and makes everything work even better from a visually
        evocative point of view: framing. Yuru Camp is a series about outdoor activities
        and one of the things it does better at representing their appeal is reflecting
        with its visual language how vast and surrounding its scenarios are, in comparison
        with, say, confined rooms. Even more difficult if you take into account that
        it has to convey these feelings through characters that are part, and are
        reacting to that environment at that same time. By placing the characters
        at the right spot of the frame and by showing an astonishing sense of space
        and depth of field, the series manages to effectively transmit to the viewer
        a feeling of belonging there, and observing the environment along with, and
        not separately from the characters. It doesn''t feature any particularly elaborate
        or flashy cinematographic trick but it does everything well in a way that
        I think very few have. A zoom-out that reveals a wonderful night view, a panoramic
        shot with the character surrounded by the immense beauty of her environment,
        a character moving towards the camera to properly reflect the depth of field.
        It is consistently clever and efficient at this and increases exponentially
        the appeal of its scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs leave more room
        for nitpicking. They have rather simple features, some kind of... questionable
        ones (what is up with those extra thin necks?) and overall they are designs
        that appeal to a fitting yet standard cutesy style. Past that level of simplicity,
        the thing is that they are actually very spot on in pretty much everything.
        They wear mundane and appropriate clothes, and the show has a surprising variety
        of outfits and styles for each of them. Particularly noteworthy is the big
        amount of aesthetic choices thrown around the character of Rin throughout
        the series, that make her quite visually dynamic and even leads to some running
        jokes with her hairstyles. Either way, I would not like to oversell the complexity
        of these character designs, since I think part of their appeal and also a
        very relevant fraction in the visual comedy of the show lie precisely in their
        simple and recognizable traits.\\n\\n\r\nThese general aspects aside, the
        show itself has a number of little issues in its visuals that depending on
        the person and the focus may look more or less serious. The animation in particular.
        It is clean, fluid and average or above average, always serviceable enough;
        but there''s not much focus on movement and the series can look quite static
        at times. It has some surprisingly complex and detailed animation but it is
        not consistent with that and specially in its latter half it abuses montages
        of static and frozen panning shots instead. The CG animation of the vehicles
        feels kind of off-putting, even with the attempts of the series to make up
        for it by focusing on the depth of field of the shot; thankfully none of these
        moments last very long. However the biggest issue comes with episode 8. It
        is pretty much universally agreed that this episode is an aesthetic low in
        the series with clumsy animation and characters going off model way too often
        throughout.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, at least in my case, the flaws feel so irrelevant
        compared to all the great visual choices it makes that this aspect of the
        show remains impressive overall, with only a few occasional nitpicks here
        and there. What I''d like to emphasize the most here is that the visual language
        in this series is crucial and it is effectively conveyed with clever decisions
        and execution. The series manages to nail the cathartic and the mundane equally
        and is one of the most purely aesthetic anime experiences I''ve seen. And
        if you think that my views on the art are too positive, wait for the next
        section.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh, how do I even start with this. It''s absolute
        brilliance from start to finish. The soundtrack is quiet and fluffy, even
        at its most playful it''s just plain laid-back. Entirely instrumental except
        for the opening and ending, it constantly evokes the atmosphere of relax and
        uneventful fun that permeates through the entire series. However what truly
        makes this series stand out in this department is not in the tracks themselves,
        but in their use in context. It understands the music not as an accompaniment,
        but as an essential element of its aesthetics and narrative. And this is specially
        relevant in a season that, overall, did not stand out much in this aspect
        and took a lot of my nitpicks for otherwise great shows. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Yuru
        Camp understands so well is that, yes, the music is fitting and sets a mood,
        but that shouldn''t stop you from playing and being active and dynamic with
        it. You can''t expect to play a beautiful song in the background, stop caring,
        and proceed to focus on the visual narrative and the dialogue, because no
        matter how good it sounds, it will end up creating an aesthetic dissonance.
        This series takes its effort to match the images, the frames and the timing
        of the narration with the soundtrack. It quite often makes use of sudden and
        accurately timed interruptions for comedic effect, it saves the most emphasized
        parts of the track for the single moments of catharsis and it perfectly captures
        the mundane. It knows when to stop and it knows when to start again, what
        track to use for each moment and how to make proper and emotionally (or comedically)
        effective transitions. If all of this sounds basic, imagine my frustration
        while watching other shows in its same season failing to understand this fundamental
        approach.\\n\\n\r\nAnd damn if it''s effective. The love and care put in this
        aspect of the show is astounding. Heck, if it even went through the trouble
        of creating a separate and fitting soundtrack for each of the campsite locations.
        That''s some level of dedication out there. Seriously, the music in this show
        is something else. Even for its generally excellent delivery this is an easy
        standout.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the aspects of its sound design are also spot
        on. I love the effects, particularly those used to create atmosphere like
        the little ambient sounds, the wind breezing... that make the experience more
        immediate and relatable. As for the voice acting, the series has a very solid
        cast with a clear standout in Yumiri Hanamori''s Nadeshiko. The way she nails
        the voice of her character, her sounds and her overall performance is essential
        to make Nadeshiko the cinnamon roll of unadulterated cuteness she is, and
        to do it with a character that was so easy to drive wrong has a lot of merit.
        Almost equal in merit and execution is Nao Touyama''s Rin, a quiet type that
        is still perfectly empathic and entertaining to listen to, and knows how to
        add relatable nuances of emotion to a character that acts cold and restrained
        towards the rest. The rest of the cast all have fitting voices and add to
        the overall mood and the comedic effect of the characters, with another favorite
        of mine being Rie Takahashi''s laid-back and playful role as Saitou. The energy
        of Chiaki and the soothing nature of Aoi are nailed as well and perfectly
        add to their style of humor. My only nitpick aside from some minor characters
        having more meh voices is with some little moments of Aki Toyosaki''s Aoi.
        The character seems to have more creative freedom than the rest of the cast
        when it comes to the way she sounds, and at some points, episode 10 in special,
        that sort of rubbed me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWith the visual and sound aspects
        covered, we can move on to the writing. And since this is just cute girls
        doing cute camping things for twelve episodes this should be fast, right?\\n\\n\r\nRight?\\n\\n\r\nYou
        know it won''t. I''m afraid you have to stay for a little while yet.\\n\\n\r\nOne
        of my biggest pet peeves with anime criticism is the, in my opinion, excessive
        reliance on themes. When it comes to a story focused on the mundane, that
        uses observational and incidental narrative and doesn''t focus in a central
        point, prioritizing in your speech the talk about transcendence and depth
        of themes is artificial and uncalled for. And I have even seen it with this
        show. It''s not like Yuru Camp doesn''t offer valuable insight on certain
        topics, I''ll get there a bit later, but to make it the main point of appeal
        of the series is, to me, missing the point and applying standards it doesn''t
        aim for. And the solution is not to dismiss the efforts of this show based
        on the simple immediacy of its premise either, specially if such immediacy
        is carried through an observant perspective that has its inherent difficulty.\\n\\n\r\nWhy
        am I bringing this up? Because the writing of Yuru Camp is excellent. It is
        a definitive standout in its genre, and it is easily the most solid I could
        find in its season. The way it understands and applies character interactions
        through its entire run is nothing short of brilliant in its apparent simplicity
        and naturality.\\n\\n\r\nThe first element I''d like to tackle is the storyline.
        What I am about to say may sound surprising, but compared to other slice of
        life shows, I think the pure story aspect in this series is actually quite
        sophisticated, or perhaps I should say tightly structured. Contrarily to what
        one could think in a show that lives up to its premise of cute girls camping
        and having harmless fun, it has a clear narrative with perfect continuity
        throughout. All the characters undergo some sort of development regarding
        their interest on camping; some become more profficient, some start to contemplate
        other alternatives... The point I want to make with this is that in this show
        the narration is, above all, consequential. It constantly refers to previous
        events or circumstances, the attachment of the characters grows throughout
        and this development is kept as a basis for future interactions, both in the
        bigger picture and in slight and seemingly irrelevant details. This is true
        for all of them but particularly, as it''s the main narrative focus, for the
        dynamics of Rin and Nadeshiko. Both learn from each other and we see how they
        gradually form an increasingly close relationship with some relevant transitions
        that have their emphasis in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the
        show is the experience of camping and the attachment to what it has to offer.
        Some people have said, not without reason, that the characters and the events
        are way too focused on camping, and that it is difficult to obtain a bigger
        picture of them when their lives and conversations are so conveniently reduced
        to their hobby. This never bothered me personally because I think the running
        theme of camping is more than enough to create a significant introspection
        to the characters, particularly because the very nature of this activity leads
        to a lot of quiet observation and naturalistic depiction, but I can understand
        this being an issue, particularly if you want to observe the characters in
        other situations or frames of mind, or if you get bored by the lack of variety
        of focus.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of its camping themes and focus, it also seems
        that a common issue among people who either disliked or don''t share the enthusiasm
        for this show lies in the presence of a voiceover narrator who tells things
        to the viewer, serving as a tutorial for camping and giving advice. This is
        something I myself feel conflicted about, not because it bothers me personally,
        but because I honestly don''t know how to draw the line and why do I find
        it acceptable and perfectly fine while other people feel completely unattached
        when it appears. To me I guess it has to do with how soothing the voice itself
        is, how it''s strategically placed in the narration to avoid unnecessary interference
        with the natural interactions of the characters, or how at times it plays
        along with the characters and their mood.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its running theme
        of camping the show talks as well about friendship and opening up to new experiences.
        And where it excels at is not so much the inherent complexity of its themes,
        but the execution and particularly in the amount of right narrative decisions
        taken throughout to build a conclusion that is constructive and inspiring.
        One of the greatest merits of the writing in this series is how it never puts
        the characters in a situation where they are stated to be in the wrong or
        need to be fixed, despite the obvious contrast in their personalities and
        approaches. This is specially true for Rin, who is introduced as an introvert
        and loves camping alone at the beginning, and through the series she develops
        a liking for camping with people. But the loner Rin is still there for the
        entire series. And her introversion is not fixed either: it is an essential
        character trait of her and the other characters respect her boundaries. A
        good deal of the laid-back atmosphere in this show is achieved through the
        mutual respect the girls feel for each other. Nadeshiko, the initially hyperactive
        and potentially invasive personality that would force Rin to change, quickly
        understands that pressuring her is wrong, and lets her grow at her own pace.
        At the same time, she learns from Rin too, while not changing a bit of her
        outgoing and enthusiastic personality. It is very refreshing to see this sort
        of development, and it speaks volumes not only to the mutual understanding
        and empathy displayed by the characters, but to the narrative focus itself
        and the respect the writing shows for their agency and individuality.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking
        of the characters, they could be defined by basic personality archetypes.
        As said, Rin is the loner introvert and Nadeshiko the outgoing enthusiast.
        This is also true for the rest of the characters who all have a set personality
        and defined traits. While some people have mentioned this as a negative, I
        don''t think Yuru Camp suffers from having characters that meet an archetype
        or *sigh* \"can be defined in a single phrase\". This is mostly because the
        writing stays refreshing and keeps finding new ways to explore the set traits
        of the characters throughout. And above all, it puts a lot of care in their
        interactions and chemistry together and with the surrounding environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe
        key word here is spontaneity. Everything in this series is built around this
        premise. The dialogues are filled with casual banter, they have some exposition
        here and there without feeling like infodumps, but the conversations feel
        perfectly down-to-earth and relatable, which is even more fascinating if one
        takes into account how quirky and differentiable their basic character types
        are. And as a result of this comes one of the greatest, and probably one of
        the most unsung, merits of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTake the scene with Saitou
        drawing a \"funny face\" in Chikuwa''s photo. Take the Outdoors Club girls''
        silly imitations of camping objects and activities. Take the Santa Clangers,
        the \"intense\" chats between Rin and Saitou, Chiaki the evil kidnapper, Nadeshiko
        the granny and so on and on and on. There is something relevant around all
        of these moments. They are funny, but they don''t need to. You don''t need
        to find these jokes amusing in order for them to make sense because the ones
        they need to make sense to are the characters themselves. This lack of pandering
        is one of the things that put this show above so many of its competitors,
        particularly in the portrayal of friendships that, like any relationship,
        have their own codes and only make perfect sense to those who share them.
        Understanding this and not trying to tell the viewer \"hey, this is funny,
        that''s why they are laughing\" but ultimately transmitting that the characters
        laugh because they genuinely, and no matter what you think, find this funny,
        is something I can never praise enough in this show. This is true even for
        Rin alone and her solitary interactions with her environment, filled with
        genuine moments of silliness and fun that are presented in the most natural
        way possible.\\n\\n\r\nA running theme with these girls and their relationships
        is the use of technology and this is another little aspect that I think deserves
        to be further emphasized. Where most other narratives either try to establish
        a contrast or never give enough importance to technology compared to \"real\",
        face-to-face interactions, Yuru Camp understands and applies both as a continuum
        of each other. They use their phones to communicate, to have fun together,
        to organize plans and etc. Rin and Saitou for instance understand each other
        extremely well, and yet, most of their interactions in the show happen through
        a phone chat. You don''t need to see them together in a room to figure out
        how strong their friendship and mutual confidence is, and when it happens
        it only confirms what we already knew. Another example is in the relationship
        of Rin and Nadeshiko and how they connect deeply with each other even when
        they are hundreds of kilometers away, to the point that at one scene Nadeshiko
        literally wants to chat with Rin and serve as a remote travel guide to her
        solo camping adventure because that way she feels connected to Rin''s journey.\\n\\n\r\nLast
        but not least in this talk about characters and writing, going back to the
        importance of spontaneity, comes the comedy. Now, we all know the issue about
        comedy so it''s not worth mentioning it again. What makes me laugh won''t
        necessarily make you laugh and so on. But I can''t deny that I laugh a lot
        with this series. Maybe even more than I could expect, considering how little
        it does to try to structure its jokes as, well, jokes. In fact, this may actually
        work in its advantage and it''s absolutely worth mentioning the lack of a
        consistent straight man routine in this series. Whenever the characters do
        something silly, they seem to prefer playing along than reacting in disbelief
        or pointing out where the joke exactly is. As a result, a lot of these comedic
        moments feel spontaneous and lacking a separated structure, and above all,
        they don''t overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately however, what makes
        Yuru Camp work and what explains its appeal to me is the synergy of all the
        individual elements mentioned above. Visual emphasis, soundtrack, character
        writing and storytelling combine to form a single and inseparable entity,
        which could only be achieved by putting individual care on each of them but
        also factoring a clear overall vision. The perfect embodiment of this lies
        in its conclusion, one of the most solid and appropriate I have ever seen
        in the medium, and which I don''t think could even be possible had the show
        not been as carefully planned and integrated as it was during its whole run.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow,
        this review went a long way. I had a lot of fun writing this, but think I
        owe you all an apology if you reached this point, specially considering that
        I haven''t even used the word \"comfy\" yet in this review of Yuru Camp. Either
        way, thanks for taking your time to read this absurdly huge piece of enthusiastic
        rambling, if you have any feedback or commentary on what I wrote feel free
        to tell me."},{"mal_id":275688,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=275688","helpful_count":6,"date":"2018-03-29T23:42:00+00:00","reviewer":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/toatsnormal","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/6753730.jpg","username":"toatsnormal","episodes_seen":12,"scores":{"overall":5,"story":2,"animation":8,"sound":7,"character":5,"enjoyment":3}},"content":"Do
        you like to see a bunch of kawaii girls overreacting to everything?  If you
        do, you''ll love Yuru Camp.  If you don''t, you probably won''t like it because
        there is nothing else.  The only \"conflicts\" in the show are generally caused
        by the overreactions, are easily resolved, and result in little permanent
        change.  The humor is also a major problem in the show.  Some of the visual
        gags and blunt deliveries of dialogue are funny, but it often disrupts the
        pacing, and most of the jokes just aren''t funny.  \r\nAnother problem is
        the constant narration.  I cansee they like the food they are all smiling,
        I don''t need all 4 characters to independently say it.  There is literally
        a narrator character for no reason who decides to interject at random points
        and completely disrupt the flow.  There are some decent characters and some
        incredibly annoying ones.  At times the music works and at times is extremely
        repetitive and distracting. The opening and ending themes are very good.\\n\r\nThe
        show does what it is supposed to do well though.  The scenery is pretty, the
        food looks tasty, and at times is relaxing.  Overall 5\/10"}]}'
