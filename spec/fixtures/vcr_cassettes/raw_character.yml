        Star, Behemoth  Violate (\u5929\u5b64\u661f\u30d9\u30d2\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8,
        Tenkosei Beh\u012bmosu no Baior\u0113to?)  is the \"shadow\" that Pandora
        put inside Alone''s shadow to guard him. This Specter has the ability to blend
        completely into darkness, as she presents herself gushing out from her master''s
        shadow and challenging Taurus Aldebaran, proving she is able to fight equally
        at Taurus'' strength. She is also able to see through the shadows of others
        as seen later in the storyline, when she is depicted kneeling before Garuda
        Aiacos, as her right arm. Here she showed to be quite merciless, as she remained
        indifferent while splattered with blood and viscera when Aiacos slaughtered
        a nearby rebel Skeleton and a damned soul. Soon after, she was sent flying
        by Aiacos'' Garuda Flap, withstanding its force and using it as a means to
        assault the Saints, freezing most of them with her mere presence, where she
        presented her first technique the Brutal Real (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb,
        Bur\u016btaru Riaru?), a titanic stomp which destroys completely the ground
        below Violate. She was stopped by Leo Regulus, whom she engaged in battle.
        Violate''s apparent physical power was confirmed when she lifted bare-handed
        the whole ship that the Saints were repairing. Violate manages to crush the
        Leo Gold Cloth''s fist, and paralyzes the Gold Saint embracing his body with
        a huge shadow, a technique called Shadow Sewing (\u5f71\u306c\u3044, Kagenui?).
        When Regulus manages to see through her ability, it is explained that she
        merges the dead from the 8th prison of Hell into the shadow so they can grab
        the enemy to stop their movement. She is killed by Leo Regulus'' Lightning
        Plasma after he used his superior Cosmo to make Violate lose her influence
        over the dead. She reappeared some time later trying to attack Aiacos, although
        she stopped her blow before even hitting him; later it was revealed that it
        was Hades who controlled the dead body of Violate.\r\nOn a side note, Behemoth
        Violate is the only female Specter to date.","member_favorites":3,"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/114528.jpg","animeography":[{"mal_id":6171,"name":"Saint
