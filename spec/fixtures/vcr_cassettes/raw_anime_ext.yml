        a high school student who had moved from Shizuoka to Yamanashi, decides to
        see the famous, 1000 yen-bill-featured Mount Fuji. Even though she manages
        to bike all the way to Motosu, she&#039;s forced to turn back because of worsening
        weather. Unable to set her eyes on her goal, she faints partway to her destination.
        When she wakes up, it&#039;s night, in a place she&#039;s never been before,
        with no way of knowing how to get home. Nadeshiko is saved when she encounters
        Rin, a girl who is out camping by herself. This outdoorsy girls story begins
        with this first encounter between Nadeshiko and Rin. (Source: Crunchyroll)","background":null,"premiered":"Winter
