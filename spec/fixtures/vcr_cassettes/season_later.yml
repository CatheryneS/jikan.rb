        of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more
        than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought,
        the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole''s hospital on a daily

        story takes place in the summer of 1907, the 40th year of the Meiji era. 15-year-old
        Inako Momokawa lives in the Fushimi area of Kyoto, and is the second daughter
        of a sake brewer. Nothing she does ever comes out right, and she receives
        a scolding from her father every day. Her only relief is the trust she places
        in her prayers to the gods. One day while at Fushimi Inari shrine, she meets
        a freewheeling young man named Kihachi Sakamoto. He rejects the gods, and
        boasts of the incoming age of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe topic of marriage suddenly
        comes up in Inako''s household. Her father is one-sidedly making all the decisions
        for her, and Inako is about to give up hope. It is then that Kihachi draws
        out Inako''s true feelings of wanting to run away from her family. The only
        way to stop her marriage is to find an unusual book called the \"Electricity
        Catalog.\" The book is a prediction book about electricity that Kihachi wrote
        when he was a child, but his older brother Seiroku took the book, and its
        current whereabouts are unknown. Inako and Kihachi together go in search of
        the book across Kyoto and Shiga prefectures.\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN)","type":"TV","airing_start":null,"episodes":null,"members":2122,"genres":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"source":"Light

        March 1992, Gainax had begun planning and production of an anime movie called
        Aoki Uru (\"Blue Uru\"), which was to be a sequel to Royal Space Force: The
        Wings of Honneamise set 50 years later, which, like Oritsu, would follow a
        group of fighter pilots. \r\n\r\nProduction would eventually cease in July
        1993: a full-length anime movie was just beyond Gainax''s financial ability;
        many of its core businesses were shutting down or producing minimal amounts
        of money.\r\n\r\nAt the 2013 Tokyo Anime Fair, Gainax announced that they
        are finally producing the Blue Uru film with Honneamise veterans Hiroyuki
        Yamaga as the director and screenwriter and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto as the character
        designer, but without Hideaki Anno''s involvement in the project.\r\n\r\n(Source:
